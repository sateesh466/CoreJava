Switch case:

	The Java switch statement executes one statement from multiple conditions. 
	It is like if-else-if ladder statement. 
	The switch statement works with byte, short, int, long, enum types, String and some wrapper types like Byte, Short, Int, and Long. Since Java 7, 
	you can use strings in the switch statement.

{    
case value1:   
 			//code for execution;    
 			break;  //optional  
case value2:

 break;  //optional  
......

......
......
Case value n:
// code for execution
 break;  //optional  

default:     
 code for execution when none of the case is true;

Inheritance

Inheritance provided mechanism that allowed a class to inherit property of another class. 
When a Class extends another class it inherits all non-private members including fields and methods.
Inheritance in Java can be best understood in terms of Parent and Child relationship, also known as Super class(Parent) and Sub class(child) in Java language


class Vehicle
{
    engine();
	BodyPart();
}

class Car extends Vehicle
{
    .......    //extends the property of vehicle class
}

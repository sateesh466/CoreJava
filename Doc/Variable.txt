Variable:

When we want to store any information, we store it in an address of the computer. 
Instead of remembering the complex address where we have stored our information, we name that address.The naming of an address is known as variable.
Variable is the name of memory location.
In other words, variable is a name which is used to store a value of any type during program execution

Syntax:

datatype variableName;	

int a = 10;


Three Types of variables:

Local Variables
Instance Variables
Static variables

class person{  

int age = 50;//instance variable 
 
static int m=100;//static variable  

sysout("N"+n);

void method(){  
	int n=90;//local variable  
}  
}


A obj1 = new A();
A obj2 = new A();


Variables naming convention in java
1) Variables naming cannot contain white spaces, for example: int num ber = 100; is invalid because the variable name has space in it.
2) Variable name can begin with special characters such as $ and _
3) As per the java coding standards the variable name should begin with a lower case letter, for example int number; For lengthy variables names that has more than one words do it like this: int smallNumber; int bigNumber; (start the second word with capital letter).
4) Variable names are case sensitive in Java

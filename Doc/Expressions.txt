Arthematic Operator:

Operator	Description

+			adds two operands
-		    subtract second operands from first
*		    multiply two operand
/	        divide numerator by denumerator
%		    remainder of division
++			Increment operator increases integer value by one
--	        Decrement operator decreases integer value by one



Relation operators:

Operator	Description

==			Check if two operand are equal
!=			Check if two operand are not equal.
>			Check if operand on the left is greater than operand on the right
<			Check operand on the left is smaller than right operand
>=			check left operand is greater than or equal to right operand
<=			Check if operand on left is smaller than or equal to right operand


Logical operators:

Operator	Description	Example

&&			Logical AND	(a && b) is false
||			Logical OR	(a || b) is true
!			Logical NOT	(!a) is false



Assignment Operators :

Operator	Description																						Example

=			assigns values from right side operands to left side operand									a = b
+=			adds right operand to the left operand and assign the result to left							a+=b is same as a=a+b
-=			subtracts right operand from the left operand and assign the result to left operand				a-=b is same as a=a-b
*=			mutiply left operand with the right operand and assign the result to left operand				a*=b is same as a=a*b
/=			divides left operand with the right operand and assign the result to left operand				a/=b is same as a=a/b
%=			calculate modulus using two operands and assign the result to left operand						a%=b is same as a=a%b
